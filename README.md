# **simple-test-speechrecognition**

A simple test of speech_recognition in python language.

This is a test script of the Speech_recognition python library. First we record what user is saying and then we translate that recording to show the translation in the console or terminal. This script translates from spanish to english, but can be easily modified to support other languages.
